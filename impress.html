                    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                    <h5>Liability for links </h5>
                    <p>
                        As the operator of this website, I do not assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with the general laws pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If I become aware of any such infringements, I will remove the relevant content immediately. My offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If I become aware of any infringements, I will remove such links immediately.</p> <br>

                    <h5>Copyright</h5>
                    <p>
                        The content and works on these pages created or used by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me accordingly. If I become aware of any infringements, I will remove such content immediately.

                    <h5>Data Protection</h5>
                    <p>
                        The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
                        We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
                        The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example through spam mails. </p>
